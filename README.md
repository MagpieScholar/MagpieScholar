Hello!  I'm MagpieScholar or The Gilded Magpie.  


I mod Skyrim and Wildermyth and I like to create datasets to populate random generators.  


I do a little voice acting, a little surface/pattern design, and a lot of writing.



Please be invited to take advantage of my bizarre knowledge base, including:

🍞 Euro-American food history!

👒 Victorian fashion!

🖤 formal mourning traditions!

📖 English grammar!

🌳 obscure Tolkien lore!

🛡️ medieval and early modern heraldry!

🦢 geese!



I also enjoy Arthuriana, vintage appliances, and learning interesting facts about cannibalism.
