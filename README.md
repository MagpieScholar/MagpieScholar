Hello!  I'm MagpieScholar or The Gilded Magpie.  I mod Skyrim and Wildermyth and I like to create datasets to populate random generators.



Please be invited to take advantage of my bizarre knowledge base on:

-Euro-American food history!

-Victorian fashion!

-formal mourning traditions!

-English grammar!

-obscure Tolkien lore!

-paper dolls!

-medieval and early modern heraldry!

-geese!



I also enjoy Arthuriana, vintage appliances, and learning interesting facts about cannibalism.
